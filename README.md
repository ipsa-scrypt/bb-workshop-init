## Introduction
Big Brain is a large project where we have to deal with LLM (large language models) and NLP (natural language processing).
<br>
However, we are not going to deal directly with LLMs in this workshop, but rather with the basics of NLP.
<br>
To do so, I have chosen to make you dive into the world of sentiment analysis, which is a very popular task in NLP.

## Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis is a task that consists in determining the sentiment of a text. For example, if we have the following sentence:
<br>
`I love this workshop!`
<br>
The sentiment of this sentence is positive. On the other hand, if we have the following sentence:
<br>
`I hate this workshop!`
<br>
The sentiment of this sentence is negative.

**Normally**, we should use AI to do sentiment analysis, but we are going to do it manually, so that you can apply what you have done previously (in the big brain welcome test).
<br>
To do so, we will manipulate TF-IDF, which is a very popular technique in NLP to our advantage.

## TF-IDF
TF-IDF is a technique that allows us to determine the importance of a word in a text. It is based on two concepts:
- TF (term frequency): the number of times a word appears in a text.
- IDF (inverse document frequency): the number of times a word appears in a corpus.
- TF-IDF: the product of TF and IDF.

A corpus is a set of texts: for example a set of sentences.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.X
- A computer :) ðŸ’»
- A brain :) ðŸ§  (not sure about this one)

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start coding! ðŸš€

## Deep dive into what's next
If you feel like you need something more complicated, you can make a neural network that does sentiment analysis.
<br>
